General repository for SeaPIG members and small collaboration efforts.

Please keep things organized in directories.

Remember to prune regularly; i.e., delete obsolete things so that others won't
have to wade through clutter. If something is rarely used but not ready to be
deleted, you can move it to an "archive" directory.
